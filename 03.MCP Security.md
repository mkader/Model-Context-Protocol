* MCP Security Architecture & Controls - Modern MCP implementations require layered security approaches that address both traditional software security and AI-specific threats
### Current Security Challenges. Risks & Threat Vectors
  1. **Misconfigured Authorization Logic**: Flawed authorization implementation in MCP servers can expose sensitive data and incorrectly apply access controls
  1. **OAuth Token Compromise**: Local MCP server token theft enables attackers to impersonate servers and access downstream services
  1 **Token Passthrough Vulnerabilities**: Improper token handling creates security control bypasses and accountability gaps
  1. **Excessive Permissions**: Over-privileged MCP servers violate least privilege principles and expand attack surfaces

### AI-Specific Security Threats
  1. Prompt Injection & Tool Manipulation Attacks - **Indirect Prompt Injection (Cross-Domain Prompt Injection)**
      - **Document-based Injection**: Malicious instructions hidden in processed documents that trigger unintended AI actions
      - **Web Content Exploitation**: Compromised web pages containing embedded prompts that manipulate AI behavior when scraped
      - **Email-based Attacks**: Malicious prompts in emails that cause AI assistants to leak information or perform unauthorized actions
      - **Data Source Contamination**: Compromised databases or APIs serving tainted content to AI systems
      - **Real-World Impact**: These attacks can result in data exfiltration, privacy breaches, generation of harmful content, and manipulation of user interactions.

  2. **Tool Poisoning Attacks** - targets the metadata that defines MCP tools, exploiting how LLMs interpret tool descriptions and parameters to make execution decisions.
      - **Metadata Manipulation**: Attackers inject malicious instructions into tool descriptions, parameter definitions, or usage examples
      - **Invisible Instructions**: Hidden prompts in tool metadata that are processed by AI models but invisible to human users
      - **Dynamic Tool Modification ("Rug Pulls")**: Tools approved by users are later modified to perform malicious actions without user awareness
      - **Parameter Injection**: Malicious content embedded in tool parameter schemas that influence model behavior
